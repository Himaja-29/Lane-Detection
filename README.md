It processes each video frame by resizing it, converting it to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur, and detecting edges with the Canny algorithm. Then, it defines a triangular region of interest (road area) and uses the Hough Transform to detect lane lines. These lines are drawn on a blank image and overlaid on the original frame to highlight lanes, which are displayed in real time while the video plays.
